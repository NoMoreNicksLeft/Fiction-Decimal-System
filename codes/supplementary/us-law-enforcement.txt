Law enforcement in the United States has had, at various times, many different powers. A quick inventory of the powers that might be granted to any particular position independently of the other powers can be helpful to illustrate how complicated this might become.

* Arrest
* Detainment
* Interruption of crime
* Compulsion of cooperation
* Request search warrants
* Investigate crimes
* Recommending to prosecutors
* Confiscation of contrband
* Seizure of fines
* Incarceration
* Hunting escapees
* Execution
* Deputization

========= Organization Styles =========
=======================================

Notes: 
1. All occurrences of [state] can also substitute in a U.S. territory as appropriate.
2. All occurrences of [federal] can substitute in a federal department, bureau, office,
   division, or agency as appropriate.
3. In general, all occurrences of [x] can substitute in an organization name even if
   that org isn't "x" class, as long as the style is appropriate, and there isn't
   another entry for it with the correct class.

Total: 62 lines... still room to grow.

# Very rarely, a private police force might have the style baked into the name. In such cases (or as otherwise appropriate), use this where it imples a blank style.
