================ Notes ================
=======================================

US Railroads are those systems using self-propelled trains and (mostly) standard gauge rail. Rail transit systems often use standard gauge, but are electrified with a third rail or overhead cables. Occasionally they use other gauges, monorails, or maglev.

Reporting marks are included for railroads. These are 2-4 character abbreviations used to identify trains and cars by those authorities responsible for the logistics of managing and sharing rail.
