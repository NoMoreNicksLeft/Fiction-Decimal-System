# Introduction

ISO 3166-1 is a standard that enumerates "country" codes. It includes an alpha-2, alpha-3, and numeric (3 digit) code for every extant country on Earth. Additionally, it includes codes for a few defunct countries, if they became defunct after the standard was implmeneted. This is only minimally useful for FDS, as many protagonists and antagonists are best described by countries no longer in existence.

This supplementary table will endeavor to list all known historical countries, and to assign to those an alpha-4 and a num-4 code. These codes will overlap with and be compatible with ISO 3166-1 by prefixing all of those numeric codes with 0 (and in this way also include extant countries). Also, it will attempt to list English exonyms, endonyms (in appropriate writing system), the mode of its demise, the (partial) date of demise, and the style of government at its demise.
