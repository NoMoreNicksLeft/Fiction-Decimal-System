WARNING: New US universities and colleges are created every year, and previous universities become defunct every year. All code numbers must remain static as soon as they are issued. This will make the current institutions unsorted quickly as new institutions require higher, unused numbers to be added to the list, and defunct numbers will be all over the place. USE TEXT SEARCH TO FIND THE CORRECT UNIVERSITY OR COLLEGE.

=======================================

This is a list of universities and colleges (where "college" refers to an institution of its own rather than a unit of a university). It strives to include historical, no-longer-extant universities as well. State/city are provided mainly to disambiguate names that are similar. It reserves space for newly created universities and other higher education entities, which apparently happens every year in some small number.

The list was built from:
