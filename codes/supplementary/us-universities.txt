WARNING: New US universities and colleges are created every year, and previous universities become defunct every year. All code numbers must remain static as soon as they are issued. This will make the current institutions unsorted quickly as new institutions require higher, unused numbers to be added to the list, and defunct numbers will be all over the place. USE TEXT SEARCH TO FIND THE CORRECT UNIVERSITY OR COLLEGE.

=======================================

This is a list of universities and colleges (where "college" refers to an institution of its own rather than a unit of a university). It strives to include historical, no-longer-extant universities as well. State/city are provided mainly to disambiguate names that are similar. It reserves space for newly created universities and other higher education entities, which apparently happens every year in some small number.

In the interest of reducing numberspace for "21 - US Police", this list will not start at 0000. This allows "University Police" to overlap with "Railroad Police" and both can use the same prefix number.

The list was built from:

=========== US Universities ===========
=======================================

Note: Alphabetized by state, then by university name. In most cases, both a "campus" and "system" code are available for those with multiple campuses. This helps for police codes, where the entire University of Illinois might have its own police department, rather than each campus having its own. Use whichever seems more appropriate.

Note: Criteria for this was hard to figure, but in the previous lists you kept seeing the same names over and over. Most were for-profit, but a few switched, and though being non-profits, they're still the kind of schools people would make fun of. Even those, though, often end up failing/in-bankruptcy. So I more or less went with the Wikipedia list.
