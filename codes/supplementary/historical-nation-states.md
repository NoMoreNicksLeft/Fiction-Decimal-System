# Introduction

ISO 3166-1 is a standard that enumerates "country" codes. It includes an alpha-2, alpha-3, and numeric (3 digit) code for every extant country on Earth. Additionally, it includes codes for a few defunct countries, if they became defunct after the standard was implmeneted. This is only minimally useful for FDS, as many protagonists and antagonists are best described by countries no longer in existence.

This supplementary table will endeavor to list all known historical countries, and to assign to those an alpha-4 and a num-4 code. These codes will overlap with and be compatible with ISO 3166-1 by prefixing all of those numeric codes with 0 (and in this way also include extant countries). Also, it will attempt to list English exonyms, endonyms (in appropriate writing system), the mode of its demise, the (partial) date of demise, and the style of government at its demise.

### Definitions

#### Style of Goverment

Shelves of books could be filled with nothing other than the descriptions of the various forms governments have taken throughout history. It's it a difficult subject to distill down to the simplicity needed for this standard, and the categories and labels chosen here are not meant to be used outside of the contexts of this list. Government types are important to this standard because it is often (perhaps even always) true that when the style of government changes for a given region, even if no other changes occur, then a new state has sprung into existence, and the old state has extinguished.

* **Poleis** - *Classical Greek city-states, small by modern standards. Sometimes including outlying lands, but as a rule only a single urban center. The essential quality was autonomia (independence).*
* **City-State** - *Small countries typically consisting of a single urban center. Some few continue to exist into the modern era.*
* **Monarchy** - *The rule of a singular person for life, with trappings and ritual, passed on to heirs as a dynasty. Rules permit the transfer of power to a new dynasty if no heirs are born of the old.*
* **Republic** - *A government that rejects monarchy. All other details vary wildly.*
* **Dictatorship** - *The rule of a singular person, by edict. New dictators replace the old, sometimes at death but also when the mechanisms of government determine the previous dictator to be inadequate. The regime will go to great effort to maintain the fiction of continuity. If a dictator assumes trappings and rituals of monarchy successfully, it becomes one.*
* **Confederation** - *A government of sovereign governments, working together. More than just allies, but less than literal unification.*

#### Demise

There are many ways for a country to cease to effectively exist. Defining these modes of demise is important for determining if an attested country is truly a historical/extinct country.

* **Collapse** - *A swift economic or ideological decline where the government ceases to meaningfully exist.*
* **Coup d'état** - **
* **Conquest** - **
* **Annexation** - *Peaceful joining to a larger or more powerful country.*
* **Unification** - *Peaceful and consensual joining of approximate equals.*
* **Revolt** - **
