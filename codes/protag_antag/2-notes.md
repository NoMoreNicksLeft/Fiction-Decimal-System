### (21) United States Police

A moderately comprehensive list of US police agencies can be found on [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_United_States_state_and_local_law_enforcement_agencies). This list goes state by state, and each sublist tends to include all Sheriff's Offices, municipal dolice departments, tribal/reservation police agencies, university police, special districts, and the various forms of state police. 

* Alabama - 100% Sheriff's (both org styles), 100% Constable's, 42% Local, 88% College/University  
  *One local uses "City of [local] Police Department" style, one college doesn't seem to exist (Russell), other two are satellite campuses.*
* Alaska - ? Local, 50% College/University, 29% Dept. of Public Safety  
  *One missing satellite campus, 5 missing Dept. of Pubsafety are just villages too small to make the cut.*
* Arizona - 0% task forces, ? Sheriff's, ? Local, 77% Tribal, ? College/University
  *Keams Canyon doesn't seem to be a reservation proper, BIA? Tonto and White Mountain Apache aren't in my list either.*
