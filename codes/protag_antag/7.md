Notes:

1. Natural pantheons includes deities from both dead and living religions; care was taken to give no preference to living religions but also
to show no disrespect. Alphabetic order by culture is used for sorting.
2. When two pantheons were reputed to have a high degree of overlap, both are listed with native names. Particularly Greek vs. Roman, and Mayan vs. Aztec.
3. Both fantasy and science fiction as genres have grown incalculaby since their advent in the late 19th or early 20th century, not all fictional gods, aliens, "races", etc. will be listed explicitly. Only those from foundational works (Tolkien, Star Trek, etc).
4. The defining characteristic of a "hero" is that he fights monsters on behalf of the pople. This covers both Hercules and Buffy the Vampire Slayer.
5. The defining characteristic of a "villain" is that he puts people in peril through the pursuit of amibitions.

TODO:

1. Need to be able to enumerate both aliens and fantasy races.
2. Need to be able to enumerate both animal-life aliens, and animal-(and monster)-like fantasy races, particularly dragon-men.
3. Dragonlance pantheon is large enough to be listed in "invented pantheons".
4. Fantastic animals needs to include "magically modified" in addition to the other subtypes.
5. Fantastic animals needs to distinguish anthropomorphic animals into three classes: true anthropomorphic (walking upright, at minimum), speaking verbally, and intellectually anthropomorphic (but retaining original shape).
6. Figure out how "monsters" works.
7. Figure out how comic book superheroes work.
